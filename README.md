 üè° Ames Housing Price Prediction

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices using the Ames Housing dataset. The project is designed for data science learners who have a foundational understanding of Python and machine learning concepts and are looking to apply advanced regression techniques in a real-world scenario.

 üìå Project Overview
- Predict the final sale price of homes in Ames, Iowa using 79 explanatory variables.
- Apply log transformation to normalize target values and ensure fair RMSE evaluation.
- Explore creative feature engineering and robust preprocessing for both numerical and categorical data.

 ‚öôÔ∏è Techniques Used
- Data cleaning and imputation using `SimpleImputer`
- Feature scaling with `StandardScaler`
- One-hot encoding for categorical variables
- Model training using `GradientBoostingRegressor`
- Logarithmic transformation for target variable
- Evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

 üìÅ Files Included
- `train.csv` and `test.csv`: Raw datasets from the competition
- `submission.csv`: Final predictions formatted for submission
- `main.py`: Python script containing the full pipeline

 üìà Evaluation Metric
Submissions are scored using RMSE between the log-transformed predicted and actual sale prices:
```math
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \log(\hat{y}_i) - \log(y_i) \right)^2}
```

üß† Learning Goals
- Practice advanced regression techniques like Gradient Boosting
- Build modular pipelines for preprocessing and modeling
- Understand the impact of feature engineering on model performance
